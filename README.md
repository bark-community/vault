## Introduction

This project aims to create a fair token launch mechanism on the Solana blockchain by implementing an anti-bot vault. This ensures that genuine supporters have an equal opportunity to participate and prevents unfair advantages by bots.

## Features

- Creation of a Solana token
- Anti-bot mechanism to protect token distribution
- Integration with front-end applications
- Comprehensive testing and security measures

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Basic understanding of blockchain and Solana
- Rust and Solana CLI installed
- A wallet with some SOL for transaction fees
- Familiarity with smart contract development

## Setup

1. **Install Rust and Solana CLI:**
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.18.15/install)"
   ```

2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bark-community/solana-token-anti-bot.git
   cd solana-token-anti-bot
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   Update your `Cargo.toml` file with the required Solana crates:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   solana-program = "1.18.15"
   solana-sdk = "1.18.15"
   spl-token = "4.0.1"
   ```

## Creating the Token & sample token

1. **Generate a new keypair for the token mint:**
   ```bash
   solana-keygen new --outfile token-keypair.json
   ```

2. **Create the token:**
   ```bash
   spl-token create-token -- token-keypair.json
   ```

3. **Create an associated token account:**
   ```bash
   spl-token create-account <TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS>
   ```

4. **Mint tokens to your account:**
   ```bash
   spl-token mint <TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS> <AMOUNT> <YOUR_TOKEN_ACCOUNT>
   ```

## Developing the Anti-Bot Vault Program

1. **Initialize the program:**
   ```bash
   cargo build-bpf
   ```

2. **Write the program logic:**
   Create a new Rust file (e.g., `src/lib.rs`) and define your anti-bot mechanism. An example is provided in the full guide.

3. **Deploy the program to Solana:**
   ```bash
   solana program deploy path/to/your/program.so
   ```

## Integrating with a Front-End Application

1. **Set up a front-end framework:**
   - Use Next.js, React and integrate Solana's JavaScript API (`@solana/web3.js`).

**1.1. Install and configure Next.js.**

```bash
Install pnpm create next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint
```

**1.2. Run the shadcn-ui init command to setup your project:**

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn-ui@latest init
```

2. **Connect to the wallet:**
   - Allow users to connect their wallets using popular wallet providers like Phantom, Solflare and Packpack.

3. **Implement token purchase interface:**
   - Ensure the token purchase process checks against the anti-bot program. Example code is provided in the full guide.

## Testing and Deployment

1. **Test locally:**
   - Use Solana's local testnet to ensure everything works as expected.

2. **Deploy to mainnet:**
   - Once tested, deploy your program to the Solana mainnet and announce your token launch.

## Security and Auditing

1. **Conduct security audits:**
   - Regularly review and audit your code internally and engage third-party security firms.

2. **Run a bug bounty program:**
   - Encourage the community to find and report security vulnerabilities.
